Detailed Blueprint Requirements Document: Trade Promotion Management (TPM) Data Product
Executive Summary
Trade Promotion Management (TPM) is a systematic process encompassing the budgeting, planning, execution, reconciliation, and evaluation of a company's trade spending to drive sales and profitability. Trade promotions are a critical component of the marketing mix for nearly every brand in CPG, serving to drive short-term demand and motivate retailers to showcase products. CPG companies allocate substantial portions of their budgets to trade promotions, often up to 25% of gross sales. However, a significant challenge is that many of these investments do not yield favorable returns on investment (ROI), with up to 80% of promotion budgets failing to contribute to category growth. Current reliance on manual spreadsheets and disjointed data often leads to inefficiencies, errors, and a lack of a single source of truth for planning and tracking promotions.
This data product aims to provide a comprehensive, integrated, and intelligent solution for managing the entire promotion cycle. By leveraging advanced capabilities, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), it will help CPG companies optimize promotional investments, accurately plan and categorize liability, strengthen retailer relationships, and enhance brand visibility. This will lead to increased sales, improved profitability, and significant operational efficiencies.
Business Goals
The primary business problems this TPM data product will solve include:
• Maximizing ROI on Trade Dollar Investment: Effective TPM is crucial to rectify unfavorable returns on investment by aligning promotions with marketing objectives, deploying appropriate strategies and discounts, and ensuring efficient execution. The goal is to drive true ROI on trade spend.
• Improving Sales and Profitability: The system will increase sales by encouraging retailers to stock and promote products more prominently, improve profitability by reducing cost of goods sold and increasing margins, and minimize unauthorized or ineffective spending. It will also enhance brand awareness and strengthen retailer relationships.
• Enhancing Forecast Accuracy: Current manual forecasting processes are error-prone and time-consuming. The data product will automate forecasting, applying modern ML techniques to leverage historical data and make accurate promotion predictions, enabling precise volume predictions and holistic forecasts. This can lead to an improvement in planning accuracy by 21%.
• Streamlining Deduction Reconciliation: Managing deductions is complex and labor-intensive. The solution will facilitate faster deduction resolution, reduce deduction aging, improve validation rates, and minimize unidentified items and write-offs. Some companies have seen a 90% reduction in deduction-processing labor.
• Automating Trade Promotion Tasks: Shifting from manual, time-intensive processes to automated, accurate account planning. This frees up sales teams to focus on selling and finance teams to analyze data for success, rather than compiling and verifying it.
• Facilitating Better Decision-Making: Providing a single source of truth across all stakeholders allows for quick changes, replanning, and re-rolling forecasts to stay competitive and agile. Data-driven insights from TPM support strategic decision-making and planning, acting as a strategic lever to enhance sales performance and revenue growth.
• Effective Financial Target Setting: Using historical spending to set goals will provide the framework needed to optimize trade promotion efforts and reach financial targets.
