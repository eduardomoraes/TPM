# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Trade Promotion Management (TPM) Data Product is a comprehensive system designed to optimize promotional investments for CPG companies. Currently, up to 80% of promotion budgets fail to contribute to category growth, with companies allocating up to 25% of gross sales to trade promotions.
